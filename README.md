# Mehrotra predictor-corrector, interiorPointMethod using a Fixed Step size
 A program that solves Linear optimization problems using the interior point method moving with a fixed step size. This is my first julia program!
 
# The program comes with a graph plotter
   - it plots the number of iterations with respect to the objective function value
 
PR is more than welcome :D
